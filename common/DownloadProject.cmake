# MODULE:   DownloadProject
#
# PROVIDES:
#   download_project( PROJ projectName
#                    [PREFIX prefixDir]
#                    [DOWNLOAD_DIR downloadDir]
#                    [SOURCE_DIR srcDir]
#                    [BINARY_DIR binDir]
#                    [QUIET]
#                    ...
#   )
#
#       Provides the ability to download and unpack a tarball, zip file, git repository,
#       etc. at configure time (i.e. when the cmake command is run). How the downloaded
#       and unpacked contents are used is up to the caller, but the motivating case is
#       to download source code which can then be included directly in the build with
#       add_subdirectory() after the call to download_project(). Source and build
#       directories are set up with this in mind.
#
#       The PROJ argument is required. The projectName value will be used to construct
#       the following variables upon exit (obviously replace projectName with its actual
#       value):
#
#           projectName_SOURCE_DIR
#           projectName_BINARY_DIR
#
#       The SOURCE_DIR and BINARY_DIR arguments are optional and would not typically
#       need to be provided. They can be specified if you want the downloaded source
#       and build directories to be located in a specific place. The contents of
#       projectName_SOURCE_DIR and projectName_BINARY_DIR will be populated with the
#       locations used whether you provide SOURCE_DIR/BINARY_DIR or not.
#
#       The DOWNLOAD_DIR argument does not normally need to be set. It controls the
#       location of the temporary CMake build used to perform the download.
#
#       The PREFIX argument can be provided to change the base location of the default
#       values of DOWNLOAD_DIR, SOURCE_DIR and BINARY_DIR. If all of those three arguments
#       are provided, then PREFIX will have no effect. The default value for PREFIX is
#       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.
#
#       The QUIET option can be given if you do not want to show the output associated
#       with downloading the specified project.
#
#       In addition to the above, any other options are passed through unmodified to
#       ExternalProject_Add() to perform the actual download, patch and update steps.
#       The following ExternalProject_Add() options are explicitly prohibited (they
#       are reserved for use by the download_project() command):
#
#           CONFIGURE_COMMAND
#           BUILD_COMMAND
#           INSTALL_COMMAND
#           TEST_COMMAND
#
#       Only those ExternalProject_Add() arguments which relate to downloading, patching
#       and updating of the project sources are intended to be used. Also note that at
#       least one set of download-related arguments are required.
#
#       If using CMake 3.2 or later, the UPDATE_DISCONNECTED option can be used to
#       prevent a check at the remote end for changes every time CMake is run
#       after the first successful download. See the documentation of the ExternalProject
#       module for more information. It is likely you will want to use this option if it
#       is available to you. Note, however, that the ExternalProject implementation contains
#       bugs which result in incorrect handling of the UPDATE_DISCONNECTED option when
#       using the URL download method or when specifying a SOURCE_DIR with no download
#       method. Fixes for these have been created, the last of which is scheduled for
#       inclusion in CMake 3.8.0. Details can be found here:
#
#           https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/commit/bdca68388bd57f8302d3c1d83d691034b7ffa70c
#           https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16428
#
#       If you experience build errors related to the update step, consider avoiding
#       the use of UPDATE_DISCONNECTED.
#
