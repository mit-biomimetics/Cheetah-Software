INTRODUCTION
============

qpOASES is an open-source C++ implementation of the recently proposed 
online active set strategy, which was inspired by important observations 
from the field of parametric quadratic programming (QP). It has several 
theoretical features that make it particularly suited for model predictive 
control (MPC) applications. Further numerical modifications have made 
qpOASES a reliable QP solver, even when tackling semi-definite, ill-posed or 
degenerated QP problems. Moreover, several interfaces to third-party software 
like ​Matlab or ​Simulink are provided that make qpOASES easy-to-use even for 
users without knowledge of C/C++.
