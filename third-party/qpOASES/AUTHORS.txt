SCIENTIFIC MENTORS
==================

We also would like to thank two persons who had a major share in making
qpOASES a success. Not by writing even a single line of code, but by
establishing the idea of using a homotopy-based approach for high-speed
QP solutions and by excellent scientific guidance during the development
process:

    Hans Georg Bock
    Moritz Diehl



All users are invited to further improve qpOASES by providing comments,
code enhancements, bug reports, additional documentation or whatever you
feel is missing.
