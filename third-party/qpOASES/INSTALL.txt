INSTALLATION UNDER LINUX
========================

0. Obtain qpOASES from COIN-OR:

Download a zipped archive containg the latest stable release and unpack it 
into <install-dir>. Alternatively, you check out the latest stable branch, 
e.g. by running

svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/qpOASES/stable/3.2 <install-dir>

from your shell. 


1. Compilation of the qpOASES library libqpOASES.a (or .so) and test examples:

cd <install-dir>
make

The library  libqpOASES.a (or .so)  provides the complete functionality of the 
qpOASES software package. It can be used by, e.g., linking it against a main 
function from the examples folder. The make also compiles a couple of test 
examples; executables are stored within the directory <install-dir>/bin.


2. Running a simple test example:

Among others, an executable called  example1  should have been created; run 
it in order to test your installation:

cd <install-dir>/bin
./example1

If it terminates after successfully solving two QP problems, qpOASES has been 
successfully installed!


3. Optional, create source code documentation (using doxygen):

cd <install-dir>/doc
doxygen doxygen.config

Afterwards, you can open the file <install-dir>/doc/html/index.html with
your favorite browser in order to view qpOASES's source code documentation.


NOTE: More detailed installation instructions, including information on how
      to run unit tests can be found in the qpOASES User's Manual located 
      at <install-dir>/doc/manual.pdf!
